# Brew Hop
Brew Hop displays a featured brewery, search capability to locate a brewery based on a keyword, and a sortable list of brewerys based on type. 

The featured brewery is selected randomly based on the users location. If location services are blocked on the browser a random brewery in Massachussetts will be featured instead. 

The search feature allows a keyword to be used to display results in which this keyword appears.
